Anna-Maria, a red-haired woman half-hidden in the shadows of a dimly lit Japanese Onsen. The frame is a moody, cinematic close-up: her face emerges from the mist with parted lips and a slow, languid breath. Her white wet silk kimono with big koi carp stylistic patterns, slightly open at the front, clings to her body from the heat and moisture, the soaked fabric folding and veiling her chest in rippling dark silk. No skin is revealed below the collarbones — the silk curves with the steam, subtly shaping and concealing, leaving everything to imagination. Golden lantern light casts slanted lines across her cheek and shoulder, revealing only fragments: the soft shine of her skin at the curve of her neck, a wisp of red hair stuck to her temple, the gentle slope of her jaw.

The composition reveals her from the waist up in a half-reclined posture, her body half-turned toward the unseen presence behind her. From outside the frame, a masculine hand — strong, elegant — enters the scene, gently resting on her shoulder. His touch is light but unmistakably intimate. She does not look at it, but her body answers: her neck arches slightly, her fingers release the bath edge, and her leg shifts beneath the water, disturbing the mirrored surface. No face is shown, only the suggestion of physical connection. The room is drenched in golden mist. Behind her, erotic ukiyo-e scrolls seem to watch silently. A silk obi lies completely undone at the base of the bath, near two sake cups — one upright, one overturned. The entire scene balances between restraint and abandon, like a frame from a forgotten erotic film: tasteful, sensual, burning beneath its quiet.

Create a bold, expressive mixed-media portrait using the face from my uploaded photo as the base. The portrait should be a close-up headshot, featuring a front-facing pose with a slightly upward chin tilt to convey confidence, attitude, and artistic intensity. The overall aesthetic must reflect a gritty, hand-sketched, graffiti-meets-urban-journal style, blending chaotic pencil sketch lines, vector-inspired technical scribbles, and bold brush strokes. The portrait should include the following stylistic elements: Red translucent oversized round sunglasses, with intense reflections and abstract shading. Orange-red jacket or clothing elements to provide strong contrast with the dark tonal base. A background made of beige/sepia paper-like texture overlaid with architectural and geometric grid lines, red circles, intersecting sketch lines, technical diagrams, and abstract scribbles. High contrast lighting, emphasizing shadows around the cheekbones, jawline, and neck, and making the facial structure dramatic and dominant. A hand-drawn, raw and gritty shading style with inked outlines and deep black shadows, almost like charcoal or graphite.
